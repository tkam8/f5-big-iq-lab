====================================

Welcome

Welcome to the |classbold| - |year|

|repoinfo|

This document details the lab exercises and demonstrations that comprise
the hands-on component of the BIG-IQ. The environment is setup with
basic configuration and associated traffic generation to populate
dashboards for easy demos. Additional configuration can be added to
support items that are not currently covered.

This lab environment is designed to allow for quick and easy demos of a
significant portion of the BIG-IQ product. The Linux box in the
environment has multiple cron jobs that are generating traffic that
populates the Monitoring tab and Application dashboard.

This lab environment is available for internal F5 users.
