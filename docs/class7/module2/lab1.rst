Lab 2.1: Using BIG-IQ AFM Logging to View Centralized Firewall logs
-------------------------------------------------------------------

.. note:: This lab uses firewall objects created on Class 7 Module 1, and also uses previously created application deployments (site36.example.com).  Please verify the application site36.example.com is a currently deployed application in your environment, and complete the steps in Module 1 before proceeding with steps below

.. include:: /accesslab.rst

Configure and Use BIG-IQ Logging for AFM
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
As of BIG-IQ 6.0, BIG-IQ supports remote log collecting and viewing for AFM policies.  The below steps will take you through the configuration required to support this feature:

1. Under *Configuration* > *Security* > *Network Security*, click *Contexts*
2. In the search bar in the upper right corner, search for ``site36``
3. Click the checkbox next to the lock symbol to select both the http and https virtual servers returned from search.
4. The *Configure Logging* button should now be available to click, click it.  

Unlike ASM logging configurations, Network Firewall logging configurations reference a number of system objects including: log publishers, destination, high speed log pools, and associated pool objects.  In order to create a logging profile to logs firewall events, these objects must already exist on the system.  By clicking *Configure Logging* BIG-IQ will create, if necessary, all the dependent objects and then create the logging profile that creates the objects.  BIG-IQ will display the dialog below, which outlines the objects that are being created:

5. Under *Configuration* > *Security* > *Network Security* > *Shared Security*, click *Logging Profiles*
6. Click the ``afm-remote-logging-profile`` created by BIG-IQ in previous step, the *Network Firewall* tab on left
7. Examine the options set by BIG-IQ when creating the logging profile.

.. note:: per 2https://techdocs.f5.com/kb/en-us/products/big-iq-centralized-mgmt/manuals/product/big-iq-centralized-management-access-6-0-1.html/23.html, none of the objects created in this manner should be modified.  Need to confirm whether this is the case.  Certainly seems reasonable that a customer would want to tweak these settings to meet their requirements.

8. Click *Cancel*

At this point, we have created all the objects necessary for logging firewall events.  However, we do need to verify that the Data Collection Devices (DCD) being used for this lab have the Network Security Service enabled.  To do this, follow the following steps:

1. We are currently logged in as Larry, the security manager, we need to log out of this role.  Then login as the admin user.
2. Under *System* > *BIG-IQ Data Collection*, click *BIG-IQ Data Collection Devices*
3. Click on the device ``bigiq1dcd.example.com``, and click *Services* on left side.
4. Scroll down to *Network Security* and verify that service status is *Active*.  If not, activate.
5. Log out of system as Admin, and log back in as Larry.


Create new Application Template Using Firewall objects
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In the steps below, we are going to attach our newly created firewall policies to application templates.

#. Under *Configuration* > *Security* > *Network Security*, click *Firewall Policies*
#. Click the checkbox next to ``f5-afm-policy_136``
#. Click the dropdown box on the *More* button and select *make available for templates*
   - the firewall policy is now available for use with application templates on BIG-IQ
#. Click *Configuration* > *Security* > *Shared Security*, click *Logging Profiles*
#. Click the checkbox next to ``afm-remote-logging-profile``
#. Click the button *Make available for templates*
   - the afm-remote-logging-profile is the logging profile BIG-IQ created for us when we configured logging in the previous exercise.

With the objects we created available for use with templates, we will now create a new template to use which references these objects.

For the steps below, we will use the **david** (or **marco**) account to manipulate application templates

#. Under *Applications* > *Service Catalog* 
#. Check the box next to the ``Default-f5-HTTPS-WAF-lb-template``, click the dropdown box on the *More* button and select *Clone*
#. Name the cloned policy ``Default-f5-HTTPS-WAF-FW-lb-template``
#. Once editing the new template, select the *Security Policies* button
#. In the *Network Security* section, set the Enforced Firewall Policy to ``f5-afm-policy_136`` for both virtual servers.
#. In the *Shared Security* section, set the Logging Profiles to ``afm-remote-logging-profile`` for both virtual servers on the Standalone Device.
#. Click *Save & Close*
#. From the Service Catalog screen, select the template you just created ``Default-f5-HTTPS-WAF-FW-lb-template``, the click the *Publish* button.

At this point, we have created a new application template that is using our newly created firewall policy and logging profiles.  Next, we will associate an existing application with our new template.

Update Existing Application To Use New Application Template
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
In previous labs, we have created and deployed a new application using a fresh template.  In this exercise, we are going to update an existing application to use a new template.

Complete the steps below logged in as **david** (or **marco**)

#. Click the *Applications* tab, and click the *Applications* button.
#. Click the application ``site36.example.com``
#. In the upper right hand corner, click *Switch to Template* button

   .. image:: ../pictures/module2/switch_to_template.png
      :align: center
      :scale: 50%

#. Select the ``Default-f5-HTTPS-WAF-FW-lb-template`` we just created.
#. In the template editor, in the Domain Names field, type site36.example.com
#. Click *Save & Close*
   - This will take a few moments, but the existing application is being re-configured with our updated template, which references our new firewall policy.
#. Once the application finishes deploying, click on the application ``site36.example.com``
#. Click the *Security* label under *Application Services*
#. Verify that the Network Firewall policy listed in the Security Configuration summary pane lists ``f5-afm-policy_136`` as the firewall policy.

Monitoring Firewall Logging On BIG-IQ
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
In this exercise, we will generate some traffic to be processes by the firewall policy, and use BIG-IQ monitoring to examine the results.

Complete the steps below logged in as *Larry*

#. Under *Monitoring* > *Events* > *Network Security*, click *Firewall*
#. View the current Firewall Event log, in filter box, enter ``site36`` to filter the log for our test application
   - At this point, you probably will not have any events in the log.
#. From the ``Ubuntu 18.04 Lamp Server`` open an SSH session.
#. From the SSH session, run the following command:

   .. code:: console 
      
      sudo nmap -sS 10.1.10.136 -D 10.1.10.7,10.1.10.8,10.1.10.9,5.188.11.1,5.188.11.2

   This will use the nmap program to scan our test application using several different source addresses.  Our firewall policy will not allow all of the sources.

#. Refresh the Firewall Event Log.  This time you should see a number of events in the firewall log.
#. Click one of the events, and examine the details available

Why is the Firewall Event log not showing accepted connections, only drops?
