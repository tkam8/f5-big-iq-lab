Module 4: Analytics Reporting
=============================

BIG-IQ offers new ways to export the statistical data that is stored on the BIG-IQ.

BIG-IQ now supports exporting chart data from Analytics dashboards to PDF. You can convert either all data from a selected time period, 
or filtered data within an Analytics screen.

BIG-IQ now provides Analytics querying capabilities from the REST-API. This allows you to access application or 
environment data that is specific to queried metrics, devices, device groups, and resource groups over a selected period of time.
