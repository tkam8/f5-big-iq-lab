Now the necessary objects have been renamed on the BIG-IP, let's remove the device 
from its own Silo and re-discover and re-import it into BIG-IQ.

1. From the Devices tab > BIG-IP Devices, select **SJC-vBIGIP01.termmarc.com** and click on
   **Remove All Services**

8. The conflict resolution window opens. Notice the profile HTTP ``silo-lab-http-profile`` is not showing anymore.
   Select **Create Version** option for all the remaining default profiles. The remaining conflicts are due to default changes
   in profiles across different TMOS versions. The **Version Specific Defaults** feature was added in a previous BIG-IQ 
   release to deal with these sorts of conflicts. BIG-IQ will store different default values for each version of SW starting
   with whats been imported originally as the default. Next click **Continue** and if prompted click **Resolve** to 
   address the version specific default conflicts.

10. You can navigate to the Configuration tab > Local Traffic > Profile and filter on ``silo-lab-http-profile``
    to confirm both HTTP profiles ``silo-lab-http-profile`` and ``silo-lab-http-profile2`` were imported. Note 
    a second copy of `silo-lab-http-profile2` still exists in the silolab Silo. Since this Silo is no longer in use 
    it will be deleted.

11. Finally, the silo ``silolab`` can be removed from BIG-IQ. Go to Devices > BIG-IP Device Silos and select the 
silolab Silo. Then click **Delete**. You may need to refresh the page to see that it is gone. That completes this lab.
