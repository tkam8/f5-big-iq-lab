5. Credentials needed for configuring Azure Provider in BIG-IQ

The following pieces of information are needed to configure an Azure Provider.
This information is required to make API calls to Azure for resource CRUD operations, either through Java or through Ansible.

- **Subscription Id**: You can get this by clicking on Subscriptions in Azure portal and copying the ``Subscription Id``.
- **Tenant Id**: Go to Azure Active Directory → Properties and copy the value of the Directory ID. This is the ``Tenant Id``.
- **Client Id**: Go to Azure Active Directory → App registrations and copy the value of the Application ID. This is the ``Client Id``.
- **Service Principal Secret**: Copy the value saved in step 5 of generating ``Service Principal Secret``.

.. warning:: we need something unique for the Username since other students do the lab, and you may use the same Azure corporate account. 

6. Subscribe to the BIG-IP instance in the ``Azure Marketplace``

Before being able to deploy an instance in ``Azure``, you'll have to **subscribe** to this license agreement.

Go here to **subscribe** to the right F5 instance we will use in this lab: 

`F5 BIG-IP VE – ALL (BYOL, 1 Boot Location) <https://azuremarketplace.microsoft.com/en-us/marketplace/>`_

Once you've subscribed, you should see something like this:

7. Create the Azure environment and VPN

The below script takes Azure parameters and creates Azure resources. These resources are used in BIG-IQ as a place to our BIG-IP to be deployed and configured.

SSH Ubuntu host in lab environment.

Navigate to: ``cd f5-azure-vpn-ssg``

Modify the **config.yml** file: ``vi config.yml``

Modify the following four items to reflect the Azure Application you created above:

- SUBSCRIPTION_ID: <Subscription Id>
- TENANT_ID: <Tenant Id>
- CLIENT_ID: <Client Id>
- SERVICE_PRINCIPAL_SECRET: <Service Principal Secret>
- PREFIX: Specify a prefix that will be used on each object automatically created.

Execute the Ansible scripts to create the Azure resources (including VPN between Azure and the lab), cloud provider and cloud environment.

``./000-RUN_ALL.sh ve``

.. note:: The Azure objects can take up to 15 minutes to complete.
