.. Note:: When you create a key, your new public/private key pair is generated and downloaded to your machine; it serves as the only copy of the private key. You are responsible for storing the private key securely. 

4. Load the credentials in Ansible Tower. Click on the *AWX (Ansible Tower)* button on the system *Ubuntu Lamp Server* in the lab environment. Use ``admin/purple123`` to authenticate.
