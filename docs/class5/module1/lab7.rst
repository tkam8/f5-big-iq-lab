Lab 1.7: Upgrade Managed Devices to New Versions of TMOS with BIG-IQ
--------------------------------------------------------------------

.. note:: Estimated time to complete: **20 minutes**

A key feature of BIG-IQ is the ability to manage software images for multiple remote devices from one location.
You can deploy software without having to log in to each individual BIG-IP device.

There are three steps to managing software images for devices:

- Download the software image from F5 Networks.
- Upload the software image to BIG-IQ.
- Install the software image on a device in the BIG-IP Device inventory in one of the following two ways:
    - Managed Device Upgrade - use this process for installing a software image on managed BIG-IP devices running version 11.5.0 or later.
    - Legacy Device Upgrade - use this process for installing a software image on BIG-IP devices running versions 10.2.4 to 11.4.1.

Official documentation about BIG-IP Software Upgrades can be found on the `F5 Knowledge Center`_.
