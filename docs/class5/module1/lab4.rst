Lab 1.4: Uploading QKviews to iHealth for a support case
--------------------------------------------------------

BIG-IQ can now push qkviews from managed devices to ihealth.f5.com and
provide a report of heuristic hits based on the qkview. These qkview
uploads can be performed ad-hoc or as part of a F5 support case. If a
support case is specified in the upload job, the qkview(s) will
automatically be associated/linked to the support case.
