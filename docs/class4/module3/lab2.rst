  - Select BIG-IQ Data Collection Devices

- For devices that were discovered before you added the DCD, you can now enable the statistics collection for those devices by going on the Devices tab and click on the “Disabled” link under Stats Collection Status.

- Click the Enabled button, accept the defaults, and click the **Save & Close** button in the lower right.

.. note:: The zone must match a zone set to a DCD. The BIG-IPs in a zone will send statistics only to the DCDs in the same zone (new from 6.1 release)

The Stats Collection Status field will go to "Task running…" while the statistics collection iApp is being installed on the target device.
