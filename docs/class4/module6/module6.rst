Module 6: BIG-IQ Zone Management
================================

Since BIG-IQ 6.1, you can have **zones** for the Data Collection Devices, DCDs.
The zoning allows you to put BIG-IP devices and DCDs in close proximity to each other while the BIG-IQ management console is in another location.
The biggest reason for doing this is to avoid any issues relating to latency between the BIG-IP and DCDs.

All DCD’s CM’s form a single ES cluster, the Zone part is for BIG-IP’s to try to connect to a local DCD.
Replication within the ES cluster does not follow Zones.

.. note:: There can still be latency issues when using BIG-IQ management console to view statistical data as the queries
          for that data are done in real-time, which means they must traverse the network for both the query and the results.

.. include:: /accesslab.rst

Configure a new DCD and setup 2 different zones
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Using the lab environment, the goal is to configure the BIG-IQ management console and DCD1 in the ``default`` zone.
The DCD2 at the other location will be in zone ``westcoast``. The BIG-IPs will be assign to the approriate zone depending on their location.

1. Let's first add a BIG-IQ DCD image in the blueprint.

- in lab environment:

In the ``F5 Products`` column, click on **ADD**

Select approriate release of BIG-IQ (same as the existing active BIG-IQ part of the blueprint) and set the following values for CPU/Memory/Disk:

    - vCPUs: 4
    - Memory: 16 GiB
    - Disk Size: 500 GiB

Click on **CREATE**.

After few minutes, the VM is created in lab environment. Click on the new VM, go to the Subnets tab and bind additional interfaces (External and Internal).

Finally, start the new BIG-IQ.

|

Then, start the new BIG-IQ DCD VM.

2. Connect via ``SSH`` to the system *Ubuntu Lamp Server*.

3. Edit the hosts file and make sure only the ``big-iq-dcd-2.example.com`` is not commented with a ``#``.

.. warning:: Double check the IP address of the new secondary BIG-IQ and update it if necessary

.. code::

    # cd /home/f5/f5-ansible-bigiq-onboarding 
    # vi hosts

    [f5_bigiq_cm]
    #big-iq-cm-1.example.com ansible_host=10.1.1.4 ...
    #big-iq-cm-2.example.com ansible_host=10.1.1.x ...

    [f5_bigiq_dcd]
    #big-iq-dcd-1.example.com ansible_host=10.1.1.6 ...
    big-iq-dcd-2.example.com ansible_host=10.1.1.9 ...

4. Once the new VE is full up and running, execute the following script to onboard this new secondary BIG-IQ CM.

    ::

        # cd /home/f5/f5-ansible-bigiq-onboarding
        # sudo docker build -t f5-big-iq-onboarding .
        # ./ansible_helper ansible-playbook /ansible/bigiq_onboard.yml -i /ansible/hosts


5. Verify the new secondary BIG-IQ DCD has been correctly added to the BIG-IQ Data Colletion Devices list.

6. Currently, there is only 1 zone defined called ``default``. We will create a new zone called ``westcoast``, keeping the ``default`` zone for the East coast.

.. note:: In order to avoid error messages complaining about the lack of a default zone, you must have one DCD at minimum have the default zone.

7. Let's define the new zone ``westcoast`` on the new BIG-IQ DCD 02 added earlier. Login on the BIG-IQ CM server, go to the **System** tab, 
   under **BIG-IQ DATA COLLECTION** > **BIG-IQ Data Collection Devices**, select the new BIG-IQ DCD 02. In **Properties**, and click **Edit**, select the Zone box, click **Create New**.

   Enter the name ``westcoast`` as the name of the new Zone.

It might takes few minutes for the new zone to be set.

8. Change the Zone of the ``SEA-vBIGIP01.termmarc.com`` and ``SJC-vBIGIP01.termmarc.com`` BIG-IP to ``westcoast``.

Select the BIG-IP device from the **Devices** menu, and select **STATISTICS COLLECTION**. 

Once selected, select ``westcoast`` from the Zone drop down menu.

It might takes few minutes for the new zone to be set.

9. Check on the Devices tab the statistic collection is happening as expected.
